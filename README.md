## Project Overview

SecureVision-SIH-2023 is our project for Smart India Hackathon 2023. We aimed to provide solutions for object detection, criminal detection, and crowd management. Our approach involved using Python for all scripts, HTML and CSS for frontend and web development, and Flask for integrating Python scripts with the web interface.

## My Contribution:
I majorly contributed to the web development (frontend work) of the project. I crafted an interactive web pages using HTML and CSS, creating templates for crowd management, object detection, criminal detection, a main navigation page, and an about us page. Collaborating with my teammate, we utilized Flask to dynamically serve content, seamlessly integrating with Python scripts for functionalities like object detection and potentially face recognition.
