        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our innovation hub! At Smart Indian Hackathon 2023, our team, "Debug Thugs," envisioned a future
            where cutting-edge technology becomes a cornerstone of public safety. Passionate about harnessing
            advancements in AI and computer vision, we set out to revolutionize crowd management, object detection, and
            criminal identification. Our journey began with a simple idea: using technology to make the world a safer
            place. Through dedication and innovation, we have turned that idea into reality.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to create solutions that empower communities and enhance public safety measures. We believe in
            the power of artificial intelligence and real-time data analysis to revolutionize the way we approach
            security. By seamlessly integrating AI-powered object detection and crowd management systems, we aim to
            create safer environments for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision is to bridge the gap between technology and societal security. We strive to create a future where
            communities are empowered with intelligent solutions. Imagine a world where public spaces are not only safe
            but also smart. With our innovative criminal detection system, we are adding an extra layer of security to
            make this vision a reality.</p>
        <p>At Debug Thugs, we are not just a team; we are a movement towards a safer world. Join us in our mission to
            revolutionize public safety and make a lasting impact on society.</p>
